The "Great Occupation" is a worldview that suggests we are forever caught in an intricate web of societal constructs, designed to manipulate our minds and command our attention. This system has its roots deeply embedded in the soils of our ancestral past.

Let's rewind to far far back. When survival was a daily uncertainty, our minds were ceaselessly preoccupied. The wilderness was an apathetic battleground, and we found ourselves in a constant state of alertness. When not dodging danger, we were consumed with hunting, gathering, or rearing our offspring.

With the advent of agriculture, we began to tame the wild, carving out a veneer of safety. Yet, even as we toiled to grow our food, our minds remained occupied, our attention enslaved by the cyclical demands of the seasons.

The real shift, however, occurred not with the plough but with the whip. We imposed chains of servitude upon one another. This cruel act freed a select few from the relentless grind of survival. With their hands no longer bound to the earth, these privileged few could now turn their minds to loftier ideas: philosophy, politics, and the nature of existence. It was from this bitter soil that democracy was born in Ancient Greece, marking the dawn of the "Great Occupation”, a system where the many are kept docile, serving the interests of the few.

The course of our lives has since become a series of scripted steps. During our most vibrant and creative years, we're confined within educational institutions, where our minds are filled with a prescribed curriculum rather than practical life skills or individual thoughts. By the time we reach the voting age, we've been fashioned into compliant cogs in a societal machine, serving the democratic illusion while preserving the status quo.

The transition to higher education often introduces an unhealthy coping mechanism: substance abuse, a tool employed to numb the monotony of our existence or the traumas of our condition.

We then march into the workforce, into jobs that feel void of purpose. We look to our employers to quantify our worth, to assign us a numerical value that barely keeps us afloat till the next pay cycle. When not labouring, we resort to the abusive habits formed during our college years, seeking to distort our reality enough to feign enjoyment in our scarce free time.

In moments when we're not working, studying, or clouded by substances, we find refuge in the glow of our devices, filling every possible moment with digital distractions. Because, if we allowed ourselves a moment of genuine contemplation, we'd have to confront the bleak reality of our existence. Such a realisation could trigger a dramatic transformation: a reinvention of our lives. But more likely, a numbing of our spirits to tolerate our reality, a reality crafted by those in power to maintain their throne.

A third of our lives are lost to sleep, while the remaining time is devoured by labour or strained study, our hearts perpetually yearning for rest. Thus unfolds our existence under the "Great Occupation". In this relentless cycle, we do not simply resemble the living dead - we become the living dead. More than just zombies, we are the embodiment of a restless yearning. This is our life's cruel irony: in the pursuit of living, we've become experts at merely existing. This is our 'Great Occupation', a ceaseless cycle from which there's no respite. A potent reminder that in our bid to survive, we may have forgotten how to truly live.
